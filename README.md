# AstroPic

Welcome to **AstroPic** â€“ a web app that brings you NASA's *Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)* right to your screen. Whether you're a space enthusiast or just curious, AstroPic lets you enjoy a daily glimpse of the cosmos with a clean and intuitive interface.

## What is AstroPic?

AstroPic connects to NASA's APOD API to fetch and display a new, breathtaking space image every day. Along with each image, you'll find a brief explanation to spark your curiosity about the universe.

## Key Features

- **Daily Space Image:** Automatically retrieves and displays the picture of the day from NASA.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Perfect for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Dark & Light Themes:** Enjoy a comfortable viewing experience, no matter your environment.
- **Informative:** Each image comes with interesting facts and context.

## How It Works

AstroPic sends a request to NASA's APOD API to get the latest image and its description. The app then displays the image in a beautifully designed layout that adapts to both light and dark modes.
